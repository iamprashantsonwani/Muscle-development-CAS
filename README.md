# Muscle-development-CAS

## Overview
This project is based on a muscle development model derived from exercise physiology principles, originally implemented in NetLogo [5]. The model aims to elucidate the factors influencing muscle growth from weightlifting, including workout frequency, sleep duration, workout intensity, and genetic predispositions such as muscle fiber composition.

## Real-time Inconsistency
An enhancement over the original model is the consideration of real-life inconsistencies, crucial for reflecting the variability encountered in actual bodybuilding pursuits. The incorporation of an inconsistency factor introduces random variations in sleep patterns and rest days between workouts. Users can toggle this feature on/off and adjust the level of inconsistency from 1% to 100%.

## Emergence and Self-organization
The project explores the concepts of emergence and self-organization in muscle development by experimenting with various parameters to demonstrate these phenomena.

## Softwares requirements
1. Python 3.8.13
2. Anaconda
3. Visual Studio code editor
4. Netlogo 6.2.2


## Library needed to run 
1. Numpy
2. Pynetlogo

If not install follow https://pynetlogo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_docs/introduction.html

## Execute the program
1. To execute the program Muscle_Development.nlogo has to be in same folder as python programs. 
2. By double clicking on Experiment1 or right click on it and go to open with Visual Studio code
3. Go to Run Python File Icon as Play button. Next netlogo model will be open and model will run on its own, now Muscle development graph will open up. by closing this graph user will see the other graph of anabolic and catabolic hormones.
4. Perform this step for rest of the files(Experiment2, Experiment3)
